# NetLogo Web Extension

This extension allows you to hook into NetLogo functionality for various forms of output and export data from NetLogo via HTTP POST.

__Requires NetLogo 5.0.4 or greater.__

## Building

Use the NETLOGO environment variable to tell the Makefile which NetLogoLite.jar to compile against.  For example:

    NETLOGO=/Applications/NetLogo\\\ 5.0
    make

If compilation succeeds, `web.jar` will be created.
